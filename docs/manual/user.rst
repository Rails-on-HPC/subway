Quick Start
=============

Installation
--------------

Install subway in one of the following approaches

- ``pip install <subway-package>``

- ``git clone . <subway-url> && python setup.py install``

- ``git clone . <subway-url> && export $SUBWAY_PATH=$(pwd)/bin``


For the third approach, you don't need to install things at all,
which might be prefect for HPC setups.

**Support platforms:** subway is compatible with python 3.5 to 3.8 in linux and macos.
